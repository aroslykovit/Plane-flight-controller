# Plane-flight-controller
The first try of autonomous flight controller for planes. Made with the help of betaflight code, but generally it is nothing in common. 

!!!Now autopilot doesnt work properly, only tests.

This controller consists of 3 parts:
- Ground module
- Main MCU of flight controller STM32f401CCU6
- Secondary controller STM32f103C6T6 for CRSF input and servo output;

Only fragments of code could be usufull for now, do not use it as it is ;)
